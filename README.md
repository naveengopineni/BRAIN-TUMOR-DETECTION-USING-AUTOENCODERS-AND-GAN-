# ABSTRACT
Brain tumor detection is a critical medical task that requires precision and accuracy to ensure early diagnosis and treatment.This project leverages deep learning techniques,specifically Autoencoders,Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),and the ResNet model, to improve the detection and classification of brain tumors from medical images. Autoencoders are utilized for efficient feature extraction and noise reduction, while GANs generate synthetic images to enhance the model's training dataset, improving its generalization capabilities. 
ResNet’s deep residual learning further refines the model’s performance,enabling accurate identification of tumor regions in brain scans while addressing challenges like vanishing gradients and overfitting.The integration of these techniques results in a robust and automated system that aids healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors with higher accuracy, speed,and reliability.The outcomes of this project contribute to advancements in medical imaging and AI-assisted diagnostic tools,ultimately leading to improved clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.
