# BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-USING-AUTOENCODERS-AND-GAN-
 This project leverages deep learning techniques,  specifically Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and the ResNet  model, to improve the detection and classification of brain tumors from medical images.
# command of running of the program 
  streamlit run appp.py
# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
  1. Autoencoders for Feature Extraction: 
    ● Reduces image dimensionality while retaining essential features. 
    ● Enhances image quality by reducing noise and irrelevant data. 
  2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Data Augmentation: 
    ● Generates synthetic MRI images to enhance dataset variability.  
    ● Improves model generalization and robustness. 
  3. ResNet for Tumor Classification: 
   ● Utilizes deep residual learning to improve classification accuracy. 
   ● Addresses common deep learning challenges like vanishing gradients.
